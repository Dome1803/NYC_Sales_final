# NYC-Rolling-Sales
## What is it?
This project analysis the New York City property market to reveal significant information and show trends concerning the property prices.

## Libraries

* Itertools - enables "groupby" for having multiple x-axis descriptions
* Scikit-learn - for machine learning methods
* GeoPandas - enables visualisations with geodata
* Descartes - used with GeoPandas to match geodata with geometrical objects from matplotlib
* Folium - meets requirements to visualize python data in leaflet maps. These maps are more interactive compared to Geopandas

## Modules

* [functions](functions.py) - functions that are used commonly, e.g. to_csv etc.
* [transform](transform.py) - most important adjustments for the dataframe
